2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-startup.git
cd bike-startup
```

3. Set up the development environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/username/bike-startup/issues) for open tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description`: New features
- `fix/description`: Bug fixes
- `docs/description`: Documentation updates
- `refactor/description`: Code refactoring
- `test/description`: Testing improvements

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Follow the code standards below
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific tests
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_feature.py

# Run linting
flake8 src/
black --check src/
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication feature

- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add password hashing
- Create user session management
- Add input validation

Closes #123"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
# - Use a clear title
# - Provide detailed description
# - Link related issues
# - Request review from maintainers
```

## 📏 Code Standards

### Python Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some additional guidelines:

```python
# ✅ Good
def calculate_total(items: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> float:
    """Calculate total price of items."""
    return sum(item["price"] * item.get("quantity", 1) for item in items)

# ❌ Avoid
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item['price'] * item.get('quantity', 1)
    return total
```

### Key Guidelines

- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Write comprehensive docstrings using Google style
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (variables, functions, classes)
- **Imports**: Group imports (standard library, third-party, local)
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions, not bare `except:`

### Code Formatting

We use automated formatters to maintain consistency:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Check style
flake8 .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/                 # Unit tests
├── integration/         # Integration tests
├── e2e/                 # End-to-end tests
├── fixtures/            # Test data
└── conftest.py         # Test configuration
```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from src.your_module import YourClass

class TestYourClass:
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test class initialization."""
        obj = YourClass()
        assert obj.is_initialized

    def test_core_functionality(self):
        """Test main functionality."""
        obj = YourClass()
        result = obj.process_data(test_data)
        assert result is not None
        assert len(result) > 0

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input_data,expected", [
        ({{"key": "value"}}, True),
        ({}, False),
    ])
    def test_edge_cases(self, input_data, expected):
        """Test edge cases with parametrized inputs."""
        obj = YourClass()
        assert obj.validate(input_data) == expected
```

### Test Coverage

Maintain test coverage above 80%:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# View report in browser
open htmlcov/index.html
```
